# 🛡️ Circuit Breaker Fix - Orchestration Loop Issue

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

**User reported:** "routePrompt itself is getting failed with 429, so it will not call other methods, but there are more than 20 calls happening. why?"

### **Root Cause**

The orchestrator has a **while loop** that calls `routePrompt` iteratively until it returns "done":

```typescript
while (iteration < maxIterations) {
  const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);
  // Execute action...
  // Loop continues...
}
```

**Each iteration** can retry independently via React Query:

```
Iteration 1: routePrompt() → 429 → retry 1, 2, 3 = 4 API calls
Iteration 2: routePrompt() → 429 → retry 1, 2, 3 = 4 API calls
Iteration 3: routePrompt() → 429 → retry 1, 2, 3 = 4 API calls
Iteration 4: routePrompt() → 429 → retry 1, 2, 3 = 4 API calls
Iteration 5: routePrompt() → 429 → retry 1, 2, 3 = 4 API calls

Total: 20 API calls! 💸
```

**The circuit breaker was tracking retries, but the orchestration loop kept starting new iterations!**

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Add Circuit Breaker Check in Orchestration Loop**

Check the circuit breaker **at the start of EACH iteration** of the while loop:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Missing check in orchestration loop)
while (iteration < maxIterations) {
  iteration++;

  // Directly calls routePrompt
  const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);
  // ...
}
```

```typescript
// AFTER (Check circuit breaker BEFORE each iteration)
while (iteration < maxIterations) {
  iteration++;

  // 🚫 CRITICAL: Check circuit breaker BEFORE each iteration
  if (circuitBreaker.isCircuitOpen()) {
    const remainingTime = circuitBreaker.getRemainingCooldown();
    console.error(
      `🚫 Circuit breaker is OPEN - stopping orchestration. Wait ${remainingTime}s`
    );
    throw new CircuitBreakerOpenError(remainingTime);
  }

  // Now call routePrompt
  const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);
  // ...
}
```

---

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Fixed Flow:**

```
User submits prompt
    ↓
Iteration 1: Check circuit breaker → OK
             routePrompt() → 429 error
             Circuit breaker: totalRetries = 1/3
             React Query: Retry with 2s backoff
             routePrompt() → 429 error
             Circuit breaker: totalRetries = 2/3
             React Query: Retry with 4s backoff
             routePrompt() → 429 error
             Circuit breaker: totalRetries = 3/3
             React Query: Retry with 8s backoff
             routePrompt() → 429 error
             Circuit breaker: totalRetries = 4/3 → OPENS! 🚫
             React Query: No more retries
    ↓
Iteration 2: Check circuit breaker → OPEN! 🚫
             throw CircuitBreakerOpenError
             STOP ORCHESTRATION
    ↓
Result: Max 4 API calls (1 initial + 3 retries)
Then orchestration stops completely
```

## 📦 **What Changed**

### **File Modified: `intelligentOrchestrator.ts`**

**Import:**

```typescript
import { circuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerOpenError } from "../lib/circuitBreaker";
```

**Added Check in While Loop:**

```typescript
while (iteration < maxIterations) {
  iteration++;

  // 🚫 CRITICAL: Check circuit breaker BEFORE each iteration
  if (circuitBreaker.isCircuitOpen()) {
    const remainingTime = circuitBreaker.getRemainingCooldown();
    console.error(
      `🚫 Circuit breaker is OPEN - stopping orchestration. Wait ${remainingTime}s`
    );
    throw new CircuitBreakerOpenError(remainingTime);
  }

  // Step 1: Ask router for next action
  const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);
  // ... rest of orchestration
}
```

---

## 💡 **Why This Fix Works**

### **Before Fix:**

```
Circuit breaker opened in iteration 1 → but loop continues!
Iteration 2 starts → calls routePrompt again → more retries → more API calls
Iteration 3 starts → calls routePrompt again → more retries → more API calls
...
Total: 20+ calls
```

### **After Fix:**

```
Circuit breaker opened in iteration 1 → loop checks at start of iteration 2
Iteration 2: Circuit breaker is OPEN → throw error → STOP LOOP
No more iterations → No more API calls
Total: Max 4 calls (1 + 3 retries)
```

## 📊 **Impact**

### **API Call Reduction (When Circuit Opens)**

| Scenario                 | Before Fix        | After Fix   | Savings  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **5 iterations needed**  | 5 × 4 = 20 calls  | Max 4 calls | **-80%** |
| **10 iterations needed** | 10 × 4 = 40 calls | Max 4 calls | **-90%** |
| **15 iterations needed** | 15 × 4 = 60 calls | Max 4 calls | **-93%** |

### **Detailed Example:**

**Before Fix:**

```
Iteration 1: routePrompt (4 calls with retries) → 429s → circuit opens
Iteration 2: routePrompt (4 calls with retries) → 429s → circuit already open but loop continues
Iteration 3: routePrompt (4 calls with retries) → 429s
Iteration 4: routePrompt (4 calls with retries) → 429s
Iteration 5: routePrompt (4 calls with retries) → 429s

Total: 20 API calls before max iterations reached
```

**After Fix:**

```
Iteration 1: routePrompt (4 calls with retries) → 429s → circuit opens
Iteration 2: Check circuit breaker → OPEN → STOP!

Total: 4 API calls, then orchestration stops
```

## 🎯 **Console Logs**

### **When Circuit Opens in Iteration 1:**

```
🔄 Starting orchestration...

Iteration 1:
⏳ 429 Rate Limit - Retry (Total: 1/3)
⏱️ Waiting 2s before retry 1...
⏳ 429 Rate Limit - Retry (Total: 2/3)
⏱️ Waiting 4s before retry 2...
⏳ 429 Rate Limit - Retry (Total: 3/3)
⏱️ Waiting 8s before retry 3...
🚫 Circuit breaker OPENED: Max retries (3) reached. Blocking all API calls for 60s.

Iteration 2:
🚫 Circuit breaker is OPEN - stopping orchestration. Wait 60s
🚨 Orchestration failed: Rate limit protection active. Too many requests. Please wait 60 seconds before trying again.
```

## 🎨 **User Experience**

### **Before Fix:**

```
User submits prompt
[Many API calls happen - 20+ calls]
Error: "Too many requests"
User confused: "Why so many calls?"
```

### **After Fix:**

```
User submits prompt
[Max 4 API calls]
🚫 Circuit breaker activated after 3 retries
Error: "Rate limit protection active. Wait 60s"
User understands: Clear message with countdown
[After 60s, can try again]
```

## 🎊 **Summary**

### **The Problem:**

- Circuit breaker tracked total retries ✅
- But orchestration loop kept starting new iterations ❌
- Each iteration called `routePrompt` with its own retries ❌
- Result: 20+ API calls even with circuit breaker ❌

### **The Solution:**

- Check circuit breaker **at the start of each iteration** ✅
- Stop the orchestration loop immediately if circuit is open ✅
- Prevent any new API calls once limit is reached ✅
- Result: Max 4 API calls (1 + 3 retries), then STOP ✅

### **What Changed:**

```typescript
// In intelligentOrchestrator.ts

while (iteration < maxIterations) {
  iteration++;

  // ✨ NEW: Check circuit breaker before each iteration
  if (circuitBreaker.isCircuitOpen()) {
    throw new CircuitBreakerOpenError(remainingTime);
  }

  const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);
  // ... rest of logic
}
```
