## 📝 **What Was Enhanced**

### **1. Better Introduction**

**Before:**

```
You are an intelligent sequential router AND extractor for a prompt analysis system.
Your job is to decide the NEXT SINGLE ACTION and if it's an extraction action,
EXTRACT THE DATA in the same response.
```

**After:**

```
You are an intelligent sequential router AND extractor for a prompt analysis system.
Your job is to decide the NEXT SINGLE ACTION and, if it's an extraction action,
EXTRACT THE DATA in the same response.

As a sequential router and extractor, prioritize actions to efficiently analyze
user prompts and extract relevant information. You will be provided with a user
prompt and a string representing completed actions.
```

**Improvement:**

- ✅ More professional punctuation (comma instead of "and")
- ✅ Explicit mention of prioritization
- ✅ Clear explanation of what the router receives

---

### **2. Enhanced Reasoning Type Awareness**

**Before:**

```
🎯 REASONING TYPE AWARENESS:
Identify which type of reasoning you're using for this decision:
- "analytical": Breaking down the prompt into components
- "sequential": Following a step-by-step process
- "pattern-matching": Recognizing patterns in the prompt
- "contextual": Understanding context from completed actions
```

**After:**

```
🎯 REASONING TYPE AWARENESS:
Identify which type of reasoning you're using for this decision:
- "analytical": Breaking down the prompt into components
- "sequential": Following a step-by-step process, considering completed actions
- "pattern-matching": Recognizing patterns in the prompt to identify relevant information
- "contextual": Understanding context from completed actions to make informed decisions
```

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Each reasoning type has more detailed explanation
- ✅ Emphasizes the role of completed actions
- ✅ Clarifies the purpose of each reasoning type

---

### **3. More Comprehensive Self-Check**

**Before:**

```
🔍 INTERNAL SELF-CHECK REQUIRED:
Before finalizing your decision, perform these checks:
1. Is this action actually needed for this specific prompt?
2. Have I already done this action (check completedActions)?
3. Is there enough information in the prompt for this action?
4. What could go wrong with this decision?
5. Is there a better alternative action?
```

**After:**

```
🔍 INTERNAL SELF-CHECK REQUIRED:
Before finalizing your decision, perform these checks:
1. Is this action actually needed for this specific prompt, considering the already completed actions?
2. Have I already done this action (check completed actions)? Use pattern matching to identify
   if the action or a similar action has been completed
3. Is there enough information in the prompt for this action?
4. What could go wrong with this decision? Consider edge cases.
5. Is there a better alternative action, considering the overall goal of extracting maximum information?
```

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Emphasizes considering completed actions in check #1
- ✅ Adds pattern matching instruction in check #2 (prevents duplicate actions)
- ✅ Explicitly mentions edge cases in check #4
- ✅ Clarifies the goal (maximum information extraction) in check #5

---

### **4. Enhanced Fallback Strategy**

**Before:**

```
🛡️ FALLBACK STRATEGY:
Always provide a fallback action in case your primary choice fails or is invalid.
```

**After:**

```
🛡️ FALLBACK STRATEGY:
Always provide a fallback action in case your primary choice fails or is invalid.
The fallback should be a logical next step given the current state.
```

**Improvement:**

- ✅ Specifies that fallback should be **logical** and **context-aware**

---

### **5. More Detailed Guidelines**

**Before:**

```
Guidelines:
- Start with "validate" if prompt needs quality checking
- Extract context actions should include extractedData immediately
- Extract only relevant info from the user prompt - omit empty fields
- Generate improvement should be near the end (after all context extracted)
- Return "done" when all relevant work is complete
- Don't repeat actions already completed
- ALWAYS include reasoningType, confidence, selfCheck, and fallbackAction
- Be honest about confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0)
- If confidence < 0.7, strongly consider using the fallback action
```

**After:**

```
Guidelines:
- Start with "validate" if prompt needs quality checking, UNLESS the prompt is known to be high quality.
- Extract context actions should include extractedData immediately. Be thorough but avoid hallucinating.
- Extract only relevant info from the user prompt - omit empty fields. Be as concise as possible in the extracted data.
- Generate improvement should be near the end (after all context extracted) or if the prompt is unacceptably bad.
- Return "done" when all relevant work is complete, meaning all useful information has been extracted.
- Don't repeat actions already completed. Use the completed actions list to prevent repetition.
- ALWAYS include reasoningType, confidence, selfCheck, and fallbackAction.
- Be honest about confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0). Calibrate your confidence based on the clarity and completeness of information.
- If confidence < 0.7, strongly consider using the fallback action. Provide a clear explanation why you're choosing the fallback.
```

**Improvements:**

- ✅ Clarifies when NOT to validate (if prompt is already high quality)
- ✅ Warns against hallucination in extraction
- ✅ Emphasizes conciseness in extracted data
- ✅ Mentions alternative case for improvement (unacceptably bad prompt)
- ✅ Clarifies "done" means all useful information extracted
- ✅ Explicit instruction to use completed actions list
- ✅ Adds confidence calibration instruction
- ✅ Requests explanation when using fallback due to low confidence

## 📊 **Impact on Router Behavior**

### **1. Better Action Selection**

**Enhancement:** "Considering completed actions" in self-check
**Result:** Router is more aware of the overall progress and makes better decisions

**Example:**

```
Before: Might suggest extractPersonal after already extracting similar info
After: Recognizes pattern in completed actions, skips duplicate, suggests next logical action
```

---

### **2. Reduced Redundancy**

**Enhancement:** "Use pattern matching to identify if the action or a similar action has been completed"
**Result:** Fewer duplicate or similar extractions

**Example:**

```
Before:
  extractIntent → extractTask → extractIntent again (slightly different)

After:
  extractIntent → extractTask → extractTags (recognizes intent already done)
```

---

### **3. Better Confidence Calibration**

**Enhancement:** "Calibrate your confidence based on the clarity and completeness of information"
**Result:** More accurate confidence scores, better fallback triggering

**Example:**

```
Before:
  Vague prompt → confidence: 0.8 → proceeds → fails

After:
  Vague prompt → confidence: 0.6 → uses fallback → succeeds
```

---

### **4. Edge Case Awareness**

**Enhancement:** "Consider edge cases" in self-check
**Result:** Router anticipates potential issues

**Example:**

```
Before:
  extractProfessional on student prompt → empty data

After:
  Recognizes student context → suggests extractPersonal/extractTask instead
```

---

### **5. Quality over Hallucination**

**Enhancement:** "Be thorough but avoid hallucinating"
**Result:** More accurate, concise extractions

**Example:**

```
Before:
  extractedData: { name: "User", location: "Unknown" } // Hallucinated

After:
  extractedData: {} or skips action // No hallucination
```

---

## 🎯 **Validation Check Breakdown**

### **Tool Separation: ✗ → ✓**

**What changed:**

- Enhanced guidelines clarify when to use each action
- Better fallback strategy ensures proper action sequencing
- Self-check prevents action confusion

**Result:** Tool separation now passes!

```
Actions already completed:
- validate
- extractPersonal
- extractIntent
```

This provides clear examples to the LLM! ✅
