## 🎯 **What Was Added**

### **1. Internal Self-Checks** ✅

The LLM now performs internal validation before making decisions.

**In the Prompt:**

```typescript
🔍 INTERNAL SELF-CHECK REQUIRED:
Before finalizing your decision, perform these checks:
1. Is this action actually needed for this specific prompt?
2. Have I already done this action (check completedActions)?
3. Is there enough information in the prompt for this action?
4. What could go wrong with this decision?
5. Is there a better alternative action?
```

**In the Response:**

```json
{
  "selfCheck": {
    "isActionValid": true,
    "potentialIssues": ["Limited personal info in prompt"],
    "alternativeAction": "extractProfessional"
  }
}
```

**Validation Logic:**

```typescript
// Check if action was already completed
if (completedActions.includes(decision.nextAction)) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ LLM suggested already-completed action`);
  // Use the LLM's own fallback
  if (
    decision.fallbackAction &&
    !completedActions.includes(decision.fallbackAction)
  ) {
    return { ...decision, nextAction: decision.fallbackAction };
  }
  return useFallback(completedActions, "Suggested action already completed");
}
```

---

### **2. Reasoning Type Awareness** ✅

The LLM now identifies and declares which type of reasoning it's using.

**In the Prompt:**

```typescript
🎯 REASONING TYPE AWARENESS:
Identify which type of reasoning you're using for this decision:
- "analytical": Breaking down the prompt into components
- "sequential": Following a step-by-step process
- "pattern-matching": Recognizing patterns in the prompt
- "contextual": Understanding context from completed actions
```

**In the Response:**

```json
{
  "reasoningType": "analytical",
  "reasoning": "Breaking down user prompt to identify components"
}
```

**Interface Updated:**

```typescript
export interface RouterDecision {
  nextAction: string;
  reasoning: string;
  reasoningType?:
    | "analytical"
    | "sequential"
    | "pattern-matching"
    | "contextual"; // NEW!
  confidence?: number; // NEW!
  selfCheck?: {
    // NEW!
    isActionValid: boolean;
    potentialIssues: string[];
    alternativeAction?: string;
  };
  fallbackAction?: string; // NEW!
}
```

---

### **3. Enhanced Fallbacks** ✅

Multiple layers of fallback strategies for robust error handling.

**In the Prompt:**

```typescript
🛡️ FALLBACK STRATEGY:
Always provide a fallback action in case your primary choice fails or is invalid.
```

**In the Response:**

```json
{
  "nextAction": "extractPersonal",
  "fallbackAction": "extractIntent",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

**5-Tier Fallback System:**

```typescript
function useFallback(completedActions: string[], reason: string): RouterDecision {
  // Strategy 1: Nothing done yet → start with validate
  if (completedActions.length === 0) {
    return { nextAction: "validate", ... };
  }

  // Strategy 2: Only validated → extract intent
  if (completedActions.includes("validate") && !completedActions.includes("extractIntent")) {
    return { nextAction: "extractIntent", ... };
  }

  // Strategy 3: Many actions done → extract tags
  if (completedActions.length > 2 && !completedActions.includes("extractTags")) {
    return { nextAction: "extractTags", ... };
  }

  // Strategy 4: Near end → generate improvement
  if (!completedActions.includes("generateImprovement")) {
    return { nextAction: "generateImprovement", ... };
  }

  // Strategy 5: Default → we're done
  return { nextAction: "done", ... };
}
```

**Confidence-Based Fallback:**

```typescript
// Check confidence level
if (decision.confidence < 0.7) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ Low confidence (${decision.confidence})`);

  if (
    decision.fallbackAction &&
    !completedActions.includes(decision.fallbackAction)
  ) {
    console.log(`✅ Using fallback: ${decision.fallbackAction}`);
    return {
      ...decision,
      nextAction: decision.fallbackAction,
      reasoning: `Low confidence fallback: ${decision.reasoning}`,
    };
  }
}
```

## 📊 **Complete Example**

### **User Prompt:**

```
"I'm a React developer building a dashboard"
```

### **LLM Response (Now):**

```json
{
  "nextAction": "extractProfessional",
  "reasoning": "User mentioned being a React developer, indicating professional context",
  "progress": "Step 2 of ~6",

  "reasoningType": "pattern-matching",
  "confidence": 0.92,

  "selfCheck": {
    "isActionValid": true,
    "potentialIssues": [
      "Limited professional details provided",
      "No company or experience mentioned"
    ],
    "alternativeAction": "extractIntent"
  },

  "fallbackAction": "extractTask",

  "extractedData": {
    "jobTitle": "React Developer",
    "techStack": ["React"],
    "ongoingProjects": ["dashboard"]
  }
}
```

### **What Happens:**

1. ✅ **Self-Check Validation:**

   - Action is valid
   - Identifies potential issues
   - Suggests alternative if needed

2. ✅ **Reasoning Type Declared:**

   - Using "pattern-matching"
   - Recognizing developer patterns in prompt

3. ✅ **Confidence Score:**

   - 0.92 (high confidence)
   - Above 0.7 threshold
   - Proceeds with primary action

4. ✅ **Fallback Ready:**
   - If extraction fails → extractTask
   - If that fails → intelligent fallback system
   - Always has a backup plan

---

## 🔍 **Validation Flow**

```typescript
// 1. LLM generates decision with self-checks
const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);

// 2. Validate decision structure
if (!decision.nextAction) {
  return useFallback(completedActions, "Missing nextAction");
}

// 3. Check for duplicate actions
if (completedActions.includes(decision.nextAction)) {
  // Use LLM's own fallback first
  if (
    decision.fallbackAction &&
    !completedActions.includes(decision.fallbackAction)
  ) {
    return { ...decision, nextAction: decision.fallbackAction };
  }
  // Otherwise use intelligent fallback
  return useFallback(completedActions, "Already completed");
}

// 4. Check confidence level
if (decision.confidence < 0.7) {
  // Consider using fallback if confidence is low
  if (decision.fallbackAction) {
    return { ...decision, nextAction: decision.fallbackAction };
  }
}

// 5. All validations passed
return decision;
```

## 🌟 **Key Features**

### **1. Self-Check System**

**What it does:**

- LLM validates its own decision
- Identifies potential issues
- Suggests alternative actions
- Provides honest assessment

**Example:**

```json
{
  "selfCheck": {
    "isActionValid": true,
    "potentialIssues": [
      "Prompt doesn't mention personal details",
      "Limited context for extraction"
    ],
    "alternativeAction": "extractTask"
  }
}
```

### **2. Reasoning Type Classification**

**What it does:**

- LLM declares its reasoning approach
- Provides transparency
- Helps debug decisions
- Enables reasoning-aware optimization

**Types:**

- **analytical**: Breaking down complex prompts
- **sequential**: Following step-by-step process

### **3. Confidence Scoring**

**What it does:**

- LLM rates its own confidence (0-1)
- Triggers fallback if < 0.7
- Honest self-assessment
- Prevents low-quality decisions

**Example:**

```typescript
if (decision.confidence < 0.7) {
  // Use fallback instead
  return { ...decision, nextAction: decision.fallbackAction };
}
```

### **4. Multi-Tier Fallbacks**

**What it does:**

- 5 different fallback strategies
- Context-aware decisions
- Intelligent recovery
- Never fails completely

**Strategies:**

1. Nothing done → validate
2. Only validated → extract intent
3. Many actions → extract tags
4. Near end → generate improvement
5. Default → done

### **5. Duplicate Detection**

**What it does:**

- Prevents repeating actions
- Uses LLM's own fallback
- Intelligent recovery
- Maintains progress

**Example:**

```typescript
if (completedActions.includes(decision.nextAction)) {
  // LLM suggested a duplicate action
  if (decision.fallbackAction) {
    // Use its own suggested fallback
    return { ...decision, nextAction: decision.fallbackAction };
  }
}
```

## 💡 **Usage**

### **For Users**

**What you'll see:**

1. **More reliable analysis**

   - Fewer errors
   - Better recovery
   - Smoother experience

2. **Better insights** (in console)

   ```
   ✅ Using fallback due to low confidence: extractIntent
   ⚠️ Low confidence (0.65) - considering fallback
   🛡️ Using fallback strategy. Reason: Missing nextAction
   ```

3. **Smarter decisions**
   - LLM thinks before acting
   - Validates its own choices
   - Has backup plans

### **For Developers**

**Enhanced decision object:**

```typescript
const decision = await routePrompt(prompt, completedActions);

console.log(decision.reasoningType); // "analytical"
console.log(decision.confidence); // 0.85
console.log(decision.selfCheck.isActionValid); // true
console.log(decision.fallbackAction); // "extractIntent"
```

**Access to detailed logs:**

```
✅ Using LLM's fallback: extractIntent
⚠️ LLM suggested already-completed action: validate
🛡️ Using fallback strategy. Reason: API error
✅ Validation passed - returning decision
```
