## 💡 Improved Prompt Example

### Original Prompt

```
Write code to fetch user data from an API
```

### After Context Learning

The system knows:

- You use React + TypeScript
- You prefer async/await
- You work with REST APIs
- You like error handling

### Improved Prompt

```
Write a React TypeScript component that:
1. Fetches user data from a REST API using async/await
2. Implements proper error handling with try-catch
3. Shows loading states
4. Uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety
5. Follows React best practices

Return the complete component with:
- Interface definitions
- Error boundary
- Loading indicator
- Proper TypeScript types
```

### Improvements Made:

- ✓ Added specific tech stack (React + TypeScript)
- ✓ Included preferred patterns (async/await)
- ✓ Added error handling
