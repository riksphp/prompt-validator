## 📚 Assignment: Prompt Qualification Process

### **Overview**

This project was built using **qualified prompts** based on advanced LLM prompting rules. The core router prompt that powers the sequential AI decision-making was enhanced through a rigorous validation process to meet professional prompt engineering standards.

### **🎯 Validation Rules Applied**

The router prompt was qualified against the following criteria:

| Rule                         | Description                                 | Status  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Explicit Reasoning**       | Prompt requires LLM to explain its thinking | ✅ PASS |
| **Structured Output**        | Clear JSON schema with examples             | ✅ PASS |
| **Tool Separation**          | Distinct actions with clear boundaries      | ✅ PASS |
| **Conversation Loop**        | Iterative processing with state awareness   | ✅ PASS |
| **Instructional Framing**    | Step-by-step guidance for the LLM           | ✅ PASS |
| **Internal Self-Checks**     | LLM validates its own decisions             | ✅ PASS |
| **Reasoning Type Awareness** | LLM declares reasoning approach             | ✅ PASS |
| **Fallbacks**                | Error handling and alternative paths        | ✅ PASS |

### **📝 Original Router Prompt (Before Qualification)**

```
You are an intelligent sequential router AND extractor for a prompt analysis system.
Your job is to decide the NEXT SINGLE ACTION and if it's an extraction action,
EXTRACT THE DATA in the same response.

🎯 REASONING TYPE AWARENESS:
Identify which type of reasoning you're using for this decision:
- "analytical": Breaking down the prompt into components
- "sequential": Following a step-by-step process
- "pattern-matching": Recognizing patterns in the prompt
- "contextual": Understanding context from completed actions

🔍 INTERNAL SELF-CHECK REQUIRED:
Before finalizing your decision, perform these checks:
1. Is this action actually needed for this specific prompt?
2. Have I already done this action (check completedActions)?
3. Is there enough information in the prompt for this action?
4. What could go wrong with this decision?
5. Is there a better alternative action?

🛡️ FALLBACK STRATEGY:
Always provide a fallback action in case your primary choice fails or is invalid.

Guidelines:
- Start with "validate" if prompt needs quality checking
- Extract context actions should include extractedData immediately
- Extract only relevant info from the user prompt - omit empty fields
- Generate improvement should be near the end (after all context extracted)
- Return "done" when all relevant work is complete
- Don't repeat actions already completed
- ALWAYS include reasoningType, confidence, selfCheck, and fallbackAction
- Be honest about confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0)
- If confidence < 0.7, strongly consider using the fallback action
```

### **✨ Qualified Router Prompt (After Enhancement)**

```
You are an intelligent sequential router AND extractor for a prompt analysis system.
Your job is to decide the NEXT SINGLE ACTION and, if it's an extraction action,
EXTRACT THE DATA in the same response.

As a sequential router and extractor, prioritize actions to efficiently analyze
user prompts and extract relevant information. You will be provided with a user
prompt and a string representing completed actions.

🎯 REASONING TYPE AWARENESS:
Identify which type of reasoning you're using for this decision:
- "analytical": Breaking down the prompt into components
- "sequential": Following a step-by-step process, considering completed actions
- "pattern-matching": Recognizing patterns in the prompt to identify relevant information
- "contextual": Understanding context from completed actions to make informed decisions

🔍 INTERNAL SELF-CHECK REQUIRED:
Before finalizing your decision, perform these checks:
1. Is this action actually needed for this specific prompt, considering the already completed actions?
2. Have I already done this action (check completed actions)? Use pattern matching to identify
   if the action or a similar action has been completed
3. Is there enough information in the prompt for this action?
4. What could go wrong with this decision? Consider edge cases.
5. Is there a better alternative action, considering the overall goal of extracting maximum information?

🛡️ FALLBACK STRATEGY:
Always provide a fallback action in case your primary choice fails or is invalid.
The fallback should be a logical next step given the current state.

Guidelines:
- ALWAYS start with "validate" as the first action if no actions have been completed yet. This is mandatory.
- Extract context actions should include extractedData immediately. Be thorough but avoid hallucinating.
- Extract only relevant info from the user prompt - omit empty fields. Be as concise as possible in the extracted data.
- ALWAYS call "generateImprovement" before returning "done". This is mandatory - every prompt must have an improved version generated.
- Only return "done" after "generateImprovement" has been completed. Check the completed actions list.
- Don't repeat actions already completed. Use the completed actions list to prevent repetition.
- ALWAYS include reasoningType, confidence, selfCheck, and fallbackAction.
- Be honest about confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0). Calibrate your confidence based on the clarity and completeness of information.
- If confidence < 0.7, strongly consider using the fallback action. Provide a clear explanation why you're choosing the fallback.
```

## 🧠 Sequential Router Architecture

### **How It Works**

Instead of deciding everything upfront, the system:

1. **Calls `routePrompt()`** → LLM decides the first action
2. **Executes that action** (e.g., validate prompt)
3. **Calls `routePrompt()` again** → LLM decides the next action (knowing what's been done)
4. **Executes next action** (e.g., extract professional info)
5. **Repeats until complete** → LLM returns "done"

### **Example Flow**

```
User Input: "I'm a React developer building an auth system"

Step 1: routePrompt() → "validate" → ✅ Validates prompt quality
Step 2: routePrompt() → "extractProfessional" → 💼 Extracts React/developer info
Step 3: routePrompt() → "extractTask" → 📋 Extracts auth system task
Step 4: routePrompt() → "extractExternal" → 🔧 Extracts React framework
Step 5: routePrompt() → "extractTags" → 🏷️ Generates tags
Step 6: routePrompt() → "generateImprovement" → ✨ Creates enhanced prompt
Step 7: routePrompt() → "done" → 🎉 Complete!
```

## 📋 Available Actions

The LLM router can choose from:

| Action                | Icon | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `validate`            | ✅   | Validate prompt quality and structure    |
| `extractPersonal`     | 👤   | Extract name, location, goals, interests |
| `extractProfessional` | 💼   | Extract job, tech stack, projects        |
| `extractTask`         | 📋   | Extract current task being worked on     |
| `extractIntent`       | 🎯   | Extract primary goal and intent          |
| `extractTone`         | 🎨   | Extract style and tone preferences       |
| `extractExternal`     | 🔧   | Extract tools, frameworks, APIs          |
| `extractTags`         | 🏷️   | Generate relevant keywords               |
| `generateImprovement` | ✨   | Create improved prompt with context      |
| `done`                | 🎉   | Signal completion                        |

   - No adaptation
   - Wastes API calls
```

### New Approach (Current)

```
✅ Decide → Execute → Decide → Execute → ...
   - Step-by-step intelligence
   - Adapts to content
   - Only runs what's needed
```

## 🚀 Performance

### API Efficiency

- **Typical prompts**: 5-8 LLM calls
- **Simple prompts**: 2-3 calls
- **Complex prompts**: 8-12 calls
- **Maximum**: 16 calls (safety limit)

### Execution Time

- **Simple**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Typical**: ~15-25 seconds
- **Complex**: ~30-45 seconds

### Cost Optimization

- Router calls are lightweight (small tokens)
- Only extracts relevant information
- Skips unnecessary steps
- Accumulates context efficiently

## 🐛 Debugging

### Enable Console Logs

Router and orchestrator log decisions and results to console.

### Common Issues

**Router loops?**

- Check max iteration limit
- Verify "done" action is being returned
- Review router prompt clarity

**Missing extractions?**

- Router decides based on content
- Not all prompts need all extractions
- Check router's reasoning in UI

**Slow performance?**

- Too many sequential calls
- Consider adjusting router prompt
- Check API response times
